# OpenAFS Client Configuration
#
# This is the default EIS AFS client configuration set for newer versions (1.6.x)
# Use at least 1.6.2 or newer! ( 1.6.0 is very buggy and 1.6.1 doesn't include the DNS AFSDB msg-size fix! )
#
# Since 1.6.x the afs-client has integrated auto-tuning.
# So specifying more options for tuning should only be applied after monitoring the system.
# candidates for tuning: -stat , -volumes
# -nosettime option is deprecated on 1.6.x and newer clients. Should not be used anymore.

#
# Disk-cache options
# Size of disk-cache is configured in file (RHEL + Solaris) /usr/vice/etc/cacheinfo or (SLE + Ubuntu) /etc/openafs/cacheinfo
# Size should not be bigger than 20% of machine's memory, so that it can fit in filesystem-caching by OS.
# It is recommended for the disk cache to be on its own dedicated partition, to guarantee that the disk does not fill up.
# On Solaris, ZFS in some scenarios does not perform well for cache behavior, so instead create a zvol with UFS for the cache partition.
# If the cache-directory (RHEL + Solaris) /usr/vice/cache or (SLE + Ubuntu) /var/cache/openafs is on a separate partition,
# the cache-size should not be bigger than 95% of the partition-size. The client will not start if cache-size is bigger!
# Default value is 1GB, size should be monitored and then be adjusted. On Terminal-servers 3-4GB is a good starting point.
# Due to a bug in OpenAFS<1.6.11 for Solaris11 and newer: Don't use ZFS for cache if openafs-version is older than 1.6.11.
# Systems using UFS are not affected (even if the UFS filesystem is on a ZFS zvol)
# AFSD_ARGS="-dynroot -afsdb -daemons 6 -volumes 1000"
AFSD_ARGS="<%= @config_client_args_real %>"

#
# Memory-cache should only be used on diskless systems!
# Don't use more than 1GB for memory-cache!
# Configured memory for memcache is completely reserved for AFS, cannot be used by something else, even if the afs-client doesn't use it!
# Example for 1GB memcache ( by specifying -blocks to afsd the configuration in cacheinfo will be ignored ):
# AFSD_ARGS="-dynroot -afsdb -daemons 6 -volumes 1000 -memcache -blocks 1000000 -chunksize 17"
